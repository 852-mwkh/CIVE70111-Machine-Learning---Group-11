    "\n",
    "### **Metrics Used**\n",
    "- **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error):** Penalises large deviations that significantly impact forecasting accuracy.  \n",
    "- **MAE (Mean Absolute Error):** More interpretable; reflects typical deviation from actual power output.  \n",
    "- **R_sqaure value :** The amount variation in actual value explained by the model\n",
    "- **Success criterion:** Lower RMSE and MAE, higher R square value indicate better model performance\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Justification**\n",
    "- Regression accuracy depends on how close predictions are to true values.  \n",
    "- RMSE and MAE directly measure deviation between predicted and actual values, clearly reflecting model performance.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Data Characteristics**\n",
    "- Weather and power values vary throughout the day and follow daily patterns.  \n",
    "- TOTAL_YIELD increases monotonically because it reflects lifetime accumulated energy.  \n",

    "- **Confusion matrix:** Visualises model prediction tendencies.  \n",
    "- **Success criterion:** Higher F1 score indicates a better model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Data Characteristics & Metric Justification**\n",
    "- Over 70% of samples are labelled as Suboptimal → **class imbalance**.  \n",
    "- A model predicting only Suboptimal could achieve high accuracy but perform poorly overall.  \n",
    "- F1 score penalises incorrect predictions of both classes, providing a fair evaluation.  \n",
    "- Classification models are sensitive to feature scale → use **MinMaxScaler** or **StandardScaler**.\n",

    "- AC, DC, and IRRADIATION drop to zero at night.  \n",

    "- Weather and generation timestamps aligned before merging.  \n",
    "- Irradiation and DAILY_YIELD sometimes show plateaus or gaps that cannot be corrected without additional data.  \n",
    "- Some inverters have fewer observations.  \n",
